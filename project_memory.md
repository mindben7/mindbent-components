# MindBenT Media - Project Memory

## Current State
**Date:** January 11, 2026
**Phase:** Sprint 1 Initialization

## Sprint 1 Decisions Locked In
- **Primary conversion goal:** Request a Social Media Audit
- **Secondary conversion goal:** Book a Call
- **Fast tertiary actions:** Message on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook
- **Reason:** The audit is the easiest “yes” for cold traffic and creates proof library quickly; booking follows naturally.

## Architecture
- **Gemini:** Strategy & PM
- **Antigravity:** Component Factory (The Builder)
- **GitHub:** Component Storage
- **Framer:** Visual Assembly & Hosting

## Website Structure
### Style System
- Dark base, high-contrast typography
- Accent colors: teal + pink neon gradients (spare use)
- Texture: subtle grain overlay, heavy "glass" feel
- Motion: Parallax grid, hover glows, slow reveals

### Home Page Sections
1. **Hero**: 3 CTAs (Audit, Book, DM), Background Video Loop
2. **What We Do**: 3 lanes (Events, Brand, Social Systems)
3. **Offer Cards**: Starter, Growth, Signature
4. **Process Timeline**
5. **Work Grid**: 9 tiles, cinematic placeholders
6. **Objections FAQ**
7. **Final CTA**

## Copy Blocks (Snapshot)
- **Hero Headline:** Option A: "MindbenT Media builds cinematic content systems for brands that need attention, not more noise." (Preferred)
- **Audit Promise:** "In 10 minutes, I’ll show you the exact content gaps that are costing you attention, and the fastest path to fixing them."

## Component wishlist
- `HeroNeon.tsx`: Fullscreen, vimeo loop, silent, property controls.
- `ParallaxGrid.tsx`: Subtle motion.
- `OfferCards.tsx`: 3-column layout.
- `SocialDMBar.tsx`: Floating or sticky.
